Project Title: **Analyzing Online Music Store Data Using SQL**

**Project Overview**:
In this beginner-friendly project, I aim to learn how to analyze data from an online music store's playlist database. By utilizing SQL, I will gain hands-on experience in examining the dataset to derive insights and help the store understand its business growth. Through this project, I will answer key questions that reflect the store's performance and customer preferences.

**Project Objectives**:

Understand the structure and components of the music playlist database.
Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data.
Answer specific business-related questions to evaluate the store's growth and customer engagement.

**Key Questions to Address**:

Which genres are the most popular among customers?
What is the total revenue generated by the store over a specified period?
Who are the top customers based on purchase frequency and amount spent?
Which artists and albums have the highest sales?
How does the sales trend vary month-over-month?

**Skills I Will Learn**:

Basic and intermediate SQL querying techniques.
Data extraction and manipulation using SQL.
Analytical thinking to interpret results and provide business insights.
Reporting findings in a clear and concise manner.
Dataset:
I will use a sample dataset representing the online music store's playlists, sales, customers, and other relevant information. This dataset will be provided at the beginning of the project.

**Deliverables**:

A set of SQL queries used to analyze the dataset.
A report summarizing the findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Visual representations (optional) to illustrate key points and trends.

**Conclusion**:
By completing this project, I will have a foundational understanding of how to use SQL for data analysis and gain practical experience in deriving business insights from a real-world dataset. This will be an invaluable skill set for me as I pursue a career in data analytics, business intelligence, or database management.
